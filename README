This repository contains the source code for the frontend of
<https://whatsmychaincert.com>, a website that helps you test and
configure SSL chain certificates.  whatsmychaincert.com tests if your
server is serving the correct certificate chain, tells you what chain
you should be serving, and helps you configure your server to serve it.
Head on over to the site for more information.

index.html is compiled from index.xml by running `make`.

To compile index.html, you need:

  * GNU Make
  * xsltproc
  * AT&T Kornshell
  * SSLMate's tlsconfigguide repository <https://github.com/SSLMate/tlsconfigguide>

By default, the tlsconfigguide repository is expected to be found
in ../tlsconfigguide, but this can be overridden by setting the
TLSCONFIGGUIDE variable in config.mk or on the make command line.

whatsmychaincert.com was developed by SSLMate <https://sslmate.com>, a
service for buying and managing SSL certs from the command line. SSLMate
saves you time and effort by automating away the error-prone tedium of
CSR generation, certificate chain assembly, and renewals.
